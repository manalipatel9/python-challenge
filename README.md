# python-challenge
#PyBank got help from AskBCS tutors Celine, Luna, and Daniel. Daniel helped me troubleshoot problems for reading the CSV file in. Celine helped me create an equation to calculate the change in "profits/losses" Luna helped me with an error I was receiving because I accidently overwrote the CSV file causing me to get an error for the whole code. I also got help from TA Mark because my code was outputting the wrong numbers, so we fixed my code a bit so I can get the write the values. And he helped me export the output to a .txt file. 
#PyPoll
I got help from AskBSC tutor Monali. And she helped guide me in figuring out how to get the correct candidate vote counts and made sure I had the right variables defined.
